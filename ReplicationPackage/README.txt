	- Source: 	https://pip.worldbank.org/shared-prosperity
	- Filename: 	PSPR ShP Final.dta
	- Description:  Global database for shared prosperity (10th edition). 
	 		countains overall mean of the distribution and mean of the bottom 40 percent for a set of comparable surveys
			Year: 	c.2014--2019
